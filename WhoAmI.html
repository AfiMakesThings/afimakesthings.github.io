								<h2>My Childhood</h2>
								<p>
									My name is Abolfazl (my nickname is Afi), and was born in Iran and studied my primary and high school in Tehran. When I was around 12 years old, 
									got interested in electronics through one of our neighbours who used to repair old telephones in his shop. Our neighbour 
									was so kind to me and I used to sit in his shop and watch him fixing telephones. I was fascinated with his job and how he could find 
									problems and fix them. I really loved his work and always had a dream to create a circuit board one day.<br /> 
									He introduced the electronics world to me and I decided to study hard and learn about electronics to achieve my childhood dream. 
									Seeing him soldering at his shop made me more passionate about electronics day by day.<br /> 

									When I was in early ages of my high school, I found out about DIY electronics kits that I could buy and build a circuit. 
									These kits were made by MehranKit and I used to save my pocket money to buy and build them.  
									These DIY kits used to come with instructions on how to identify and solder the components onto the PCB.<br /> 
									I had so much fun with making these circuits and I remember it used to take hours and hours to build them. I gained some basic knowledge 
									about electronic components as well as soldering skills.<br />
									During my high school, I made more than 30 projects. The variety of these projects was quite good for me. 
									I started with simple and cheap projects such as an LED flasher, and a dual LED flasher using a multivibrator, dimmer, alarms, and counters. 
									Gradually I bought more complex kits such as FM radio transmitters, microphone amplifiers, voice recorders and so many more.<br /> 
									I was one of the top students until the first year of high school but I slowly got distracted from the school because of the side projects. 
									I still managed to be among the top 10 students during my last years of high school.<br /> 
									I had to take the university entrance exam and get very good marks to be able to get into a public university and follow my dream of 
									becoming an electronics engineer.<br /> 
									More than 500000 students attended the exam in the math and physics stream and only the top 500 students 
									would be able to enrol in public universities to study electronics (electronics engineering was a competitive major among all other 
									engineering majors).<br />
									Unfortunately, the exam didn't go well for me and I failed to get enough marks to choose electronics engineering. 
									Two months later, I took the university entrance exam for private universities. This time I got the best marks and enrolled in Karaj 
									private university to study my dream major, electronics engineering. 
								</p>
									
									 <h2>University Days</h2>
									<p>
										I was so excited to study for a bachelor of electronics engineering at university. The first two semesters I studied generic 
										math and physics subjects however, I struggled to pass the exams because of the inefficient method of subject delivery throughout 
										the semesters (and a bit of my laziness :)).<br />
										During my bachelor's degree, I kept making circuits at home and slowly purchased electronic components. After 5 years of studying, 
										I managed to create my electronic lab with a range of components and testing equipment such as a DC power supply, oscilloscope, and signal 
										generator.<br />
										From the second year of my course, I studied more electronics-related subjects. 
										Since I love to create circuit boards in my lab, I used to test most of the circuits that I learned in the classroom.
										Below is an image of my bedroom (my lab). My parents sent all my components and equipment to me from Iran. Apologies for my messy desk :). 
									</p>

									<p>
										I have an uncle who works as a mechanical designer for TV game shows to develop unique scenes for entertainment purposes. 
										Occasionally he would ask me to assist him with some programming or circuit designs. He is experienced in making metal works, 
										creating platforms and automation. He used to use induction motors along with relay and contactor circuits to power them up. 
										For instance, in one of the projects, I helped him with driving a stepper motor and created the control circuit and Arduino program for that.<br /> 
										The following video is one of the projects that I had an opportunity to work with him.

									<p>
										I graduated with a bachelor's degree in electronics engineering in 5 years and then I found out about a course in aircraft maintenance 
										engineering. This field of study and work was fascinating for me and I decided to try and learn more about aviation (specifically Avionics) 
										and their electronic systems. <br />
										During this course, I had a chance to attend several practical workshops along with theoretical tutorials. The course took around two years 
										to finish and I received a course completion certificate so I could attend the national certification test to obtain an 
										Aircraft Maintenance License from CAO (Civil Aviation Organisation). I was able to pass this exam as well and receive the certificate that 
										would allow me to work in the aviation field.<br />   
										I did a month of internship at IranAir and 6 months at AsemanAir. Unfortunately, I could not secure a job in this field due to the 
										high unemployment rate in the country. Eventually, I decided to move to Australia and continue my education and study for a master's degree. 
									</p>
									<h2>Life In Australia</h2>
									<p>
										I moved to Australia to study for a Master's degree in Professional Engineering (Electrical and management) in 2019 and graduated in 2021.  
										Fortunately, I found my first part-time job before finishing my studies (last semester) then I was granted a temporary graduate visa that 
										allowed me to work full-time for two years.<br />  
										I joined CNC Automation as a graduate engineer and worked there for about a year. This job was a good start for my engineering career 
										in Australia. I had an opportunity to learn Skycad and create electrical schematics for automation purposes including PLCs, 
										3-phase motors, and VSDs as well as PLC programming and troubleshooting. Other than that, I used to troubleshoot electronic circuits and 
										provide feedback to improve the designs. I had the opportunity to be involved in projects from the beginning of production, deliver, 
										commission, and provide training for customers.<br /> 
										My second job was in NOJA Power and worked there for around two years. Working in this company helped me to significantly improve my 
										organizational skills along with a massive boost of technical knowledge. I joined the company as a junior electronics engineer but 
										soon moved to the test and automation team. I learned a lot about switchgear products and how they are manufactured, tested, and validated 
										in the factory. I worked with Altium Designer to design and troubleshoot PCBs, prepare manufacturing files, and create new control circuits 
										for testing and automation. I started learning LabVIEW to understand more about test applications and eventually develop new test systems. 
										Thanks to my mentor and supervisor, Brent Joyce, who continuously supported me throughout the learning curve of LabVIEW.<br />  
										I am currently working as an electrical design engineer at GroundProbe to develop new products to make mining safer. 
										I perform a variety of different tasks such as troubleshooting PCB designs, testing and automation, design reviews, and improving reliability.
									</p>
									<h3>My Hobbies and Interests</h3>
									<p>
										Besides my passion for electronics and DIY projects, I play indoor and beach volleyball in my spare time. 
										I also have a black belt (4th Dan) in Karate with around 19 years of experience. 
										I attended several national tournaments and was a part of Iran's national team for a while.
										I play soccer and table tennis if I get a chance but my favorite sport is volleyball at the moment :).
									</p>


									<h2>Final Words</h2>
									<p>
										I created this webpage to showcase my portfolio and my background. I consider myself a passionate electronics engineer who loves 
										conquering challenging projects. Despite my education (Electronics and Electrical Engineering), I am interested in taking a step 
										further and working as a mechatronics engineer if it expedites the progress of the project.<br />
										I have done numerous projects in the past but my portfolio webpage only includes the ones that I have a record of them. 
										Creating the portfolio webpage was one of the main items on my to-do list for my professional career. <br />
										<b>I hope you enjoy it, thanks for visiting my webpage :).</b>
