									<h1>PLC and LabVIEW Automation</h1>
									<p>This is an HMI created in LabVIEW <br />

								<h2>Background Story</h2>
								<p>
									I worked on this project as part of my previous roles to automate a test jig. This jig had a servo motor and driver 
									attached to a PLC to control the behaviour of the jig and capture all the required test results.<br />
									The test jig was created a while ago but there was a major issue with the HMI and functionality of the PLC. I was assigned 
									to revise the design and troubleshoot the PLC program along with the LabVIEW HMI.<br /> 
									Other than the existing work, I needed to add new features to the test jig and its HMI to make it compatible with new products 
									to the test jig.
									I also improved the PLC code and added some ladder logic to make the test jig safer to use. <br />
									I worked on this project for around a month to add all the features and details to reliably test and validate products.	
								</p>
									
									<h2>Key Features</h2>
								<p>
									The LabVIEW HMI detects the model of the product using the scanned barcode attached to the products. 
									Once the specific model of the product is defined, all the required test limits (stored in a text file) are loaded into the LabVIEW application. <br />
									As part of test initialization, an OPCUA communication is created between PLC and LabVIEW to transfer data and commands 
									to and from the PLC (OPCUA stands for Open Platform Communications Unified Architecture). <br />
									OPCUA is a communication protocol widely used in automation that simplifies machine-to-machine communication regardless of the brand 
									and model of devices.<br />
									The servo motor was quite powerful and it needed to be safe to use at all times, so I added extra safety features to stop the test jig 
									and the motor in case of any major failure. Other than that, I added a soft stop and an emergency stop button to completely disable the motor.<br />
									Below is a screenshot of the timeout state of the LabVIEW HMI to read all the required variables from the PLC.

								</div>
								<br />
								<p>
								According to the product specification and minimum test requirements, I added extra code to my LabVIEW application to reliably evaluate 
								the unit under test in four independent stages. Below is a screenshot of the first stage of product evaluation.

								</div>
								<br />
								<p>
								Finally, all the test results and evaluations are printed into a Word or Excel sheet to keep a record of that. 
								Other than that, test result values were imported to SQL database tables for future product studies and performance trends.<br /> 
								Below is a screenshot of the reporting state in LabVIEW.

									 <h2>Challenges and Solutions</h2>
									<p>
										The main challenge of this project was mechanical failures that could slow down the process of validation of my LabVIEW and PLC code. 
										I had close collaboration with the mechanical team to ensure the functionality of the test jig before software testing.<br />
										The product under test was sensitive and operators were not allowed to test it more than three times because overtesting a unit could 
										severely impact its lifespan. It was not difficult for me to implement a feature in the  LabVIEW code to prevent this but operators 
										would separate a failed unit (in the first test) from the production line to repair and rectify the issue. Since the operator would stop 
										the LabVIEW application and test another unit while the faulty unit is being repaired, the LabVIEW application would lose track of the 
										number of tests on the faulty unit. <br />
										I managed to improve the code by creating a folder and text file for each serial number to update the number of the conducted tests 
										on the unit then the text file would have been read during the initiation of a new test run.<br />
										Finally, the below image shows the front panel of the test application.

									<h2>Final Words</h2>
									<p>
									I enjoyed working on this project because I learned about the OPCUA communication protocol and how LabVIEW can connect to a 
									sophisticated PLC and servo motor. I had the opportunity to work on a PLC program and servo motor.<br /> 
									Brainstorming was one of the main parts of this project because I needed to create something simple, robust, reliable, and easy to maintain. <br />
									In terms of LabVIEW programming, I learned about OPCUA, SQL database updates, working with text files, creating folders, creating Word and 
									Excel documents, and simplifying the user interface.
