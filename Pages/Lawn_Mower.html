								<h2>Background Story</h2>
								<p>
									One of my friends used to work in hospitals and aged care facilities. At his workplace, there were a bunch of broken electric 
									beds and wheelchairs about to be thrown out. He asked his manager to get those parts and hopefully do a DIY project with them. 
									He received two electric beds and one wheelchair and salvaged two linear jacks and two DC motors.<br /> 
									In the meantime, I found a broken remote control online that someone was giving away for free. According to the owner, 
									the transmitter stopped working, turned off and never turned back on. I picked up the transmitter as well as the receiver 
									and was hoping that could be an easy fix for me because I suspected a power issue in the transmitter after noticing some 
									rusty and corroded battery terminals. I managed to turn the transmitter on and then simply configure the receiver using its user manual.<br /> 
									Initially, we made a small single-blade lawn mower and then proceeded even further to build a large dual-blade version.								
								</p>
									
									<h2>Key Features</h2>
									<p>
										Regarding the DC motors, we found an online datasheet with the motor's important characteristics such as current rating, 
										maximum speed, and wiring detail. After extensive research, we decided to use a Sabertooth motor controller to drive the motors. <br />
										The Sabertooth board that we used, was a two-channel motor controller capable of delivering 32A to each motor. 
										This board had a USB port that could connect to a computer for configuration and tuning purposes. 
										The Sabertooth controller is quite an intelligent board with several protection features such as overtemperature, 
										short circuit and over-current shutdown. <br />
										Using DIP switches the working principle of the motors could be defined to change between normal and tank-style mixing modes.
										The tank-style mode allows the lawn mower to do a 360-degree turn. Other than that, the receiver signals could be directly fed 
										into the board and processed by the motor driver.<br />
										<h3>The First Version</h3>
										The mainframe of the first version was salvaged from an old electric wheelchair. I attached the main cutter blade to an old car 
										battery (which was accessible to us) through a high-power switch to be able to 
										turn the blade on and off manually. The second lead acid battery was used to deliver power to the motor controller and DC motors.<br />
										The radio transmitter has several different configurations such as channel mixing options and trigger setups. For instance, 
										I configured the transmitter to switch between low-speed and high-speed modes by toggling one of the switches on the transmitter. 
										This feature maps the signal values into different scales so the output signal would be tuned based on these settings.<br />
										Below is a short video of the first version of the RC lawn mower cutting the grass.

										<h3>The Second Version</h3>
										The second version of the lawn mower was much more powerful than the first one. The mainframe was salvaged from a 
										ride-on-mower with two cutting blades and a petrol engine. The front wheels come with a DC motor attached to them and it was easier 
										for us to attach them to the main frame with the motors attached to the wheels (the front motors are not used).<br /> 
										This system had a couple of considerable advantages over the previous version with a battery-powered blade. 
										For instance, the petrol engine can deliver more power to the blades and the electrical part of the lawn mower is isolated 
										from the blade driving system. <br />
										The rear wheels are on the same axis (shaft) and are driven by a large DC motor and another motor with a gearbox is used for steering. 
										The both motors are attached to the Sabertooth motor driver.<br />
										Finally, we added a linear actuator to the blade platform to be able to adjust the vertical distance of the blades from the grass. 
										This feature allowed us to set the height of the grass to cut depending on the land.<br /> 
										Below is a short video of the second version of the lawn mower and how it is developed and tested.

									 <h2>Challenges and Solutions</h2>
									<p>
										The engine would need to start with a switch attached to a solenoid. To be able to remotely start the engine, 
										I attempted to use one of the signals from the radio receiver for this purpose however I needed to convert the PWM signal 
										to a logic level and enable or disable the solenoid through an electromechanical relay.<br />
										Besides engine control, I needed to measure the battery voltage to detect the low battery and stop the system to prevent 
										any undesired behaviour. <br />
										Eventually, I built a circuit board using an Arduino and relay to start the engine along with battery measurement and 
										low-battery indicator features.<br />
										Below is the circuit that I designed for this purpose. 
									</p>

									<p>
										Initially, I attempted to build the PCB at home due to time constraints however, the outcome was not quite satisfying 
										so I ordered PCBs to JLCPCB and assembled the board and tested it in my lab. 
										Below is a short video of all the PCB building stages and testing procedures.<br />
										Apologies in advance for my messy desk:)

										One of the interesting parts of the project was designing the height adjustment actuator. This feature would allow 
										the user to remotely adjust the grass height by moving the blade platform up and down. 
										I used the linear actuator salvaged from the electric bed to implement this feature. 
										The linear motor had some sort of internal stopper to stop the actuator at the end of the stroke. 
										I only needed to configure one of the channels of the receiver to enable and disable a relay to deliver power to the actuator. <br />
										Lastly, the PWM signals needed to be calibrated for the main motor and the steering motor. The Sabertooth motor driver has a 
										micro USB port to facilitate the programming and calibration process using the Sabertooth user interface which is called "DEScribe".<br />  
										Below is a screenshot of the application that simplifies the PWM signal settings and mid-point of the signal.

									Other than all the electrical and mechanical challenges, I designed a holder to mount all the high-power Anderson connectors 
									to the lawn mower chassis and protect them against any damage and short circuits.<br /> 
									The below image shows the 3D-printed part using my Ender3 printer in my lab.

									<h2>Final Words</h2>
									<p>
										This project was the most challenging in terms of mechanical and electrical complexities. The majority of mechanical parts 
										were done by my friend and all the electrical/electronic section of the project was done by me such as attaching all the 
										motors and actuators along with their control circuits. <br />
										This project probably took around 3 months to finish and I planned to add many more features to make this machine safer and more reliable. 
										For instance, a sensor that could detect any dangerous slopes that could potentially flip the lawn mower. 
										This could be extremely dangerous because once the lawn mower is flipped upside down, the blades would still be rotating at 
										the maximum speed. This feature could detect this condition and disable the blade by shutting down the engine.<br />
										Overall, this was a successful project with a deliverable outcome. I enjoyed working on this machine and trying to add new 
										features with the salvaged parts from old and broken electrical equipment.
