									<h1>H-Bridge <br />DC Motor Driver</h1>
									<p>This project is done based on an off-the-shelf DC motor driver,<br /> 
										aiming to reverse engineer the PCB and schematic. </p>

									<h2>Background Story</h2>
									<p>I use Altium Designer for PCB designs at work and EasyEDA for my DIY projects. 
										This is one of the projects that I did to learn more about creating schematics and PCBs using online tools. 
										I usually use EasyEDA to create my schematics and PCBs. 
										This online tool is quite handy for quick PCBs without getting into too many details and complexities.
										Other than that, the PCB ordering process is significantly simplified, 
										with just a few clicks the PCB can be ordered from JLCPCB. 
										As I remember, my first PCB order was almost free and I just paid for shipping. 
									</p>
										<h2>Key Features</h2>
										<p>
											This motor driver is a two-channel H-bridge driver. 
											A PWM signal can be fed into the board as well as a direction pin. 
											The speed of the motor can be adjusted using an external PWM signal and the direction of the motor can be reversed
											 using a control pin. The selected MOSFETs can handle up to 15A of current for each channel.
											 The maximum voltage that could be used for driving the DC motors is 40v. 
											 This PCB is dual-layer with a dimension of around 100X75 mm.
											 The high current power supply and DC motor wires connect to the PCB using the Phoenix screw terminals
											  on the side of the board. Other than that, all the control signals are fed to the circuit via pin headers.</p>
										
										 <h2>Challenges and Solutions</h2>
										<p>
											Reverse engineering was a bit of a challenge and I spent some time to precisely identify all 
											the traces and connections. I attempted to capture the traces and add them to my schematic to reduce 
											the complexity of it. 
											Once I identified all the traces, I attempted to explain and justify the components on the PCB 
											to be able to clarify my schematic. <br />
											I had purchased the PCB from Aliexpress and there were some components on the board that I could not find 
											any datasheet for them. One of the components that I struggled to find datasheet,  was the buck converter 
											chip to provide a stable 5v for the logic circuit. The high power source could be converted to a lower 
											voltage (5v) and used by other parts of the circuit.<br /> 
											This board does not have a heatsink for high-power MOSFETs. High-current motors could potentially damage the 
											MOSFETs and the driving circuit. I could probably improve the circuit with a new layout to create some 
											room for heatsinks.<br />
											Initially, I designed the PCB layout but I realized that the 3D view is incomplete due to using components
											without a 3D file. Then I decided to replace all the components with the one with a 3D view/file.
											This took a bit of to do and also adjust the existing schematic and PCB layouts. <br />
											It is quite important to review any part in the library of the EasyEDA to confirm the symbol, 
											footprint, and 3D model before adding it to projects.
										</p>
											The following image shows the schematic of the board drawn using EasyEDA.

										<h2>Final Words</h2>
										<p>
											This project was one of the very first PCBs that I used EasyEDA to design. 
											The PCB design using this online tool is quite simple and quick. I designed this PCB to learn about EasyEDA and never 
											intended to order it from JLCPCB.  <br />
											In my opinion, Altium Designer is the most advanced software for designing PCBs however, 
											it is a paid software so I preferred to use an online tool for this purpose. 
											As I mentioned earlier, One of the features that I like about this online tool is the direct 
											PCB ordering process without generating manufacturing files such as Gerber, Pick and Place, NC drill and BOM. 
											PCBs are ordered through JLCPCB at an affordable price.
