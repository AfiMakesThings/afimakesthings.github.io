								<h2>Background Story</h2>
								<p>When I was studying for my bachelor's degree, I got interested in making a taser gun for fun. 
									I watched so many YouTube videos to get some ideas and make one. 
									The majority of the videos that I watched, used off-the-shelf high-voltage transformers to generate voltages above 100kV. 
									These transformers are quite cheap and accessible through eBay and Amazon however, 
									due to sanctions against the country, banking, and shipping restrictions, I decided to make a transformer in my lab.<br />
									I found some transformers with ferrite cores in my lab and removed all the existing windings. 
									I calculated the primary and secondary voltage ratio of the transformer and using some online tools, 
									found a suitable wire for this purpose. Because the wire was so thin (probably around 0.2mm), 
									the winding process was so difficult. <br />
									To generate 50 to 100kV in the secondary of the transformer, I needed to wind the coil for a couple of thousand turns. 
									As I remember, I did the winding manually almost 20 times but failed to finish it because of difficulty in counting turns and breaking the wire accidentally. 
									Eventually, I decided to make the coil winding machine for this purpose.</p>
									<h2>Key Features</h2>
									<p>
										This machine has a 12v DC motor with a simple PWM speed controller. 
										Using a NE555 timer I managed to make a PWM signal and adjust the speed of the motor using a potentiometer (volume). 
										To count the turns, I used a hall sensor and a magnet attached to the coil holder shaft so 
										I could get a signal in every revolution then fed these signals to an Arduino to increment a counter. 
										The Arduino converts these values to arrays that could drive a 3-digit seven-segment and show the turns accurately. 	
										</p>
									<h2>Challenges and Solutions</h2>
									<p>
										The high speed of the DC motor was one of my concerns in this project but 
										I had a motor with a gearbox attached to it to reduce the speed and enhance the torque. 
										Other than that, I used my benchtop power supply to power up all the control circuits as well as 
										the DC motor.<br />
										Because I needed to wind the coil roughly between 1000 and 2000 turns, 
										I used the decimal point to indicate that the number was over 1000.<br /> 
										The major challenge was making the mechanical fixture and assemble all together. 
										I didn't have a 3D printer and I had to make something from scratch to hold everything together. 
										I used a whiteboard marker as a shaft to hold the core of the coil and glued the magnet to it. 
										I also glued the shaft of the motor to the marker because didn't have a shaft coupling.

									<h2>Final Words</h2>
									<p>
									I tried to make this machine as quick as possible so I could get back to making a DIY taser. 
									Finally, I managed to wind a coil for my project however, I couldn't make a reliable taser and had some component failures. 
									I learned a lot about driving 7-segments, Arduino counter, hall sensor, DC motor, and NE555 motor driver. 
									This project could be further developed with the possibility of 3D-printing the mechanical parts. 
									Other than that, a wire traveller could also make this machine fully autonomous.
