									<h1>Tesla Cybertruck<br />
									3D Model</h1>
									<p>This is one of the most complex 3D designs that I have ever done,<br />
										Full of challenges and complex features.</p>

									<h2>Background Story</h2>
									<p>I used to take some short courses on LinkedIn and Udemy to learn about Fusion360. 
										As I remember, I was improving slowly and always looking for new design ideas to learn about 
										more complex features of Fusion360.<br /> 
									I was quite impressed with the release of Tesla Cybertruck and its shape and bold features. 
									Because of its sharp edges and simplicity of curves, I decided to design it in Fusion360. 
									I designed it when I was studying for my Master's degree so I could spend more time on this project. 
									It took about two weeks to complete the design. My goal was to learn more about 3D designing so 
									I chose to design Cybertruck and give it away as a present to my cousin's son.
									</p>
										<h2>Key Features</h2>
										<p>
											Based on all the information I had at the time, I tried to implement all the features of the Cybertruck
											into my design. <br /> 
											One of the main features of this design is the wheels and how they are designed. 
											I have made the wheels detachable to simplify the printing process and make it more fun to assemble all the pieces.
											The rear bumper has some curved features that are quite similar to the actual car model. 
											Other than that, I also made a special number plate for the gift.<br /> 
											The following image shows the rear view of the model.

												</div>
											</p>
										 <h2>Challenges and Solutions</h2>
										<p>
											This design was the first complex project for me and I did not know how to design parts as components
											and join all of them together in the end. This added so much more complexity to my design because any
											small change would affect the entire design.<br />
											The rear bumper was one of the few curved shapes that I managed to design it in one piece and combine with the existing part. For this purpose, 
											I used the Form feature of the Fusion360 that allows me to manually create and form a curved surface. 
											The following image shows a snapshot of this feature.

											
											<div class="container">
											<img id="toggleImage" src="/images/Cybertruck/bumper.jpg" alt="My Project Image" class="image1" width="60%" height="auto">
											</div>
											<br />
											Moreover, the extra flap under doors and fenders took more effort to design because I needed to use the 
											sweep function and drag a cross-section of a profile all around the car to create identical flaps.<br />
											Printing the design was another interesting part of this project. I have an Ender3 printer at home and 
											used it for this project. I adjusted and scaled the dimensions to be able to print the model with my printer. 
											Using Cura slicer, I managed to print the wheels, bolts and nuts at once then print the main body of the car. 
											During the print I had some issues with levelling the bed of my printer however, I used some bed leveling G-code 
											to get it bed level so the printed parts could firmly stick to the bed and avoid warping in the corners.<br />

											The below video is an animation of the finalized design.

											<style>
												.AfiVidSize {
													/*width: var(--image-size, 40%);  Default width from HTML */
													width:70%;
													
												}
											
												@media screen and (max-width: 768px) {
													.AfiVidSize {
														/*width: calc(var(--img-size, 40%) * 2);  Double the width for mobile */
													width:90%;
													}
												}
											</style>

										<br />
										<h2>Final Words</h2>
										<p>
											This project is one of my best 3D designs. I learned several new features in Fusion360 to design and build more realistic parts. 
											For example, features such as profile sweep, revolve, forming curve body, etc... <br />
											I also learned to create an animation for the design to present all the features of the design properly.
											In the end, after printing the design using my Ender3 printer, I gave the printed Cybertruck to my cousin's son as a 
											birthday gift but sadly he broke its wheels in less than an hour. <br />
											My main goal from the project was to improve my Fusion360 skills and be able to create and print a 3D model from scratch.
